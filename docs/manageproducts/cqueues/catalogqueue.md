   > _Note:_ The searchbar uses two different criteria. You can either use the **producr identifier** or **catalog name** searchbar.

4. **Catalog Details** page opens up. Scroll down to the fields that needs to be edited. Check and edit the data.

5. Toggle OFF the **Add To Catalog Queue** option.

   > **IMPORTANT**:
   > The **Add To Catalog Queue** is only enabled when the catalog being created is missing of the vital data. Instead of publishing a catalog with incomplete details it is added to the **Catalog Queue** section.
